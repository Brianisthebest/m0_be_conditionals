# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    - Pretty good! I feel like it's been pretty straight forward so far just checking the values of the variables that are defined.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    - Same! Checking to see if things are both true/false, or if one or the other is true or false is feeling good.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    - I've enjoyed playing around with the if statements. It's fun knowing there isn't just one way to figure out a solution either.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    - I put aside an hour and a half for conditionals and it only took me about an hour. Feeling pretty good about my time estimates so far. I'd rather set aside a little too much time then not enough to feel rushed.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I plan on updating my calendar to try and free some time up over the weekend and look into playing around with some more methods. I'm also looking to checking out some of those resources for Mod 1 for the few weeks I have between this and Mod 1 beginning. I want to set myself up for success as much as possible for Mod 1.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - Google. I know there are resources out there that I can find to check out, so I'll go out and find them.
